      <h2>College</h2>
      <p>My first steps on trying to be a Neonatal Nurse is going to college.Go through the progams I need. To be able to have enough experience I will shadow another nurse who works in the same field I want to go into.Also doing internships which help me get a boost in the field. It would be a mini practice run so I have an idea of what to do when I actual go into the real thing.</p>
      <h2>Jobs</h2>
      <p>I would have to go into some training for the job. And with the experience I have bulit from over the years it'll be easier for me to find a job.The experience will show that I will be talking my job seriously.</p>
      <h2>After</h2>
      <p>After having the job for a few years, I would like to get a higher degree so I can make more money. It's not all about the money either, having a higher degree will give me more experience and maybe to be in more control.</p>

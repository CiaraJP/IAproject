    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>The reason why I want to become a Neonatal Nurse it's because it's an intresting career. Working with infants and taking care of them in a fragile state is heartwarming for me. Knowing I can help them during a hard time is everything to me, because they would depend on me in a time of need. </p>
